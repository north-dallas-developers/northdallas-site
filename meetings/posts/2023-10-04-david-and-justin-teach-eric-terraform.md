title: David and Justin Teach Eric (and You) Terraform
date: '2023-10-06'

# {{ title }}

My name is Eric. I have been a developer for two decades and I have never written a Terraform script. It’s used a ton though, so I should learn to use it.

Justin and David both use Terraform. In order to help me get over my ignorance, they are going to teach me in the meeting, and I will setup a static website on AWS live using Terraform. We’ll (at least) create an EC2 instance, setup a Dynamo table, and setup an S3 bucket with it. If you come prepared ([see the instructions in this readme](https://github.com/north-dallas-developers/d-and-j-teach-e-tf)), you can do this live with us as well and we’ll help you out. If you have any issues getting setup, you can come early at 5:30 and we can help you out.

If you are unfamiliar with AWS that's okay. We will also explain the AWS-related bits as we go along.

**NOTE**: Please pull down the [repository](https://github.com/north-dallas-developers/d-and-j-teach-e-tf) ahead of time and have the pre-reqs completed

**NOTE**: This meeting is in-person. Also, [Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.

To keep up-to-date with Eric's strange technology, Latin, and Greek adventures, you can [follow him on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Mallioch), [subscribe on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCHcJejvdlXxLlG0encr53Q), or [follow him on his blog](https://ericsowell.com/blog).
