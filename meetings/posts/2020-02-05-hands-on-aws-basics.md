# {{ title }}

As you know, lots of companies and developers use AWS to build their stuff. This means experience in using AWS can really be beneficial. But it sure is hard to get started alone...

In this hands-on session, you will build a self-contained dotnet core application, you will get that running on a couple of EC2 instances, you will setup a Sql Server database on AWS RDS, and you will create a load balancer for those two servers. Along the way we will discuss the AWS management console, VPCs, security groups, subnets, and more. And you will do this all on your own AWS account, so you can do with it whatever you want. If you have been looking to get started with AWS, and want to do it with a little commentary and a lot of help, this is the session for you.

Requirements:

* Bring your laptop, Windows, Mac, or Linux.
* Sign up for AWS, because you will be doing these labs on your own account.
* Install dotnet core 3.1
* Sql Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio, or something to connect to Sql Server.
* If you are using Windows, install WinSCP.
* Note that running things on your AWS account will cost you money. However, if you shut everything off when we're done, the whole thing will probably cost you less than a couple dollars. Since we'll be using mostly free tier stuff, it might not cost you anything.
