Gain full visibility into your .NET applications by implementing observability with traces, metrics, and logs. In this presentation, weâ€™ll explore how to instrument .NET apps using OpenTelemetry to monitor performance and detect issues. Learn how to set up distributed tracing for tracking requests, capture custom metrics for health monitoring, and implement structured logging for efficient debugging. By the end, you'll have the tools and knowledge to optimize your .NET applications, reduce downtime, and enhance troubleshooting through effective observability practices.
