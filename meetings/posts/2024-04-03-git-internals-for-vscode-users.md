# {{ title }}

For many, the graphical user interface of VSCode simplifies git, streamlining commands into digestible, one-click operations. However, this simplicity prevents many from truly understanding what actually happens when commands such as 'push', 'pull', 'fetch', and 'rebase' are executed. This talk aims to shed light on these inner workings, illuminating the depth of git within the VSCode environment.

Dive into the realm of 'detached heads', explore the distinction between 'merge' and 'rebase', unravel the mystery of 'cherry-pick', and comprehend the differences between 'fast-forward merges' and 'merge commits'. Additionally, we'll discuss how to figure out how to see what actual git command are being called under the covers by non-native VSCode git buttons like "sync". Each topic will be addressed using relatable analogies, breaking down complexities and enriching your understanding of git operations in VSCode.

Come prepared to learn, share, and embrace the union of git internals and VS Code's GUI tools. Let's take your git comfort & understanding to the next level!
