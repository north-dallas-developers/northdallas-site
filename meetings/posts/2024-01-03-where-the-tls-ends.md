# {{ title }}

There is a place where TLS ends and before C# begins, and there the software flows soft and bright.

In this talk we will review what is TLS, what are basics about certificates, and how to we connect this with a C# website/API. This will be mostly a coding exercise, happening from an AWS perspective.

Yes we'll code with a code that is measured and slow, And we'll go where the up-down arrows go, for the developers, they mark, and the developers, they know the place where TLS ends.

[Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.
