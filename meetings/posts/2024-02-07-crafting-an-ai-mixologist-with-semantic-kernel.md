# {{ title }}

Prompts play a crucial role in communicating and directing the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) AI. They are queries to extract useful responses from a model. Semantic Kernel is like a mixologist who looks at available ingredients and crafts new cocktail recipes. Semantic Kernel looks at different plugins, AI Prompts, and memory stores to create an execution plan.

Attend this presentation to learn how Semantic Kernel can be used to build a copilot thatâ€™s creative enough to suggest new cocktails. Cheers!

You will learn:

* When to use Semantic Kernel?
* How to customize your own AI copilot
* The Do's and Don'ts in building a copilot

[Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.
