Transformative projects are complex, large scale initiatives that fundamentally alter a product and significantly impact its stakeholders.
It is very hard to build good software and incredibly harder to build them in the context of a transformative project.
This presentation is a compilation of key learnings, insights & examples in the form of leadership lessons from building these projects over the course of my 15 year career in tech.

[Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.

My name is Arun Gopalakrishna and I am Sr. Manager at Capital One who is reimagining online car buying and wants to change car buying for the good. 
I moved to the US a decade ago for my Masters at A&M, and  currently live in McKinney with my wife and 2 kids. In my free time I love playing chess, basketball and cricket.

I have previously worked at companies like PwC, Schneider Electric, Armor & Capgemini - and have had the opportunity to work on very impactful projects.
Passionate about technology and leadership I aim to keep learning from my own experiences, networking with other leaders, blogs & podcasts. I'm always looking for learning opportunities to share my learnings and insights.
