Why do users prefer native apps over webapps?  It's more than just a speed issue – this preference would remain even if webapps were suddenly 10x faster.  It's not a browser issue either as evidenced by beloved Electron apps like Spotify, Slack, and VSCode.  The "webapp handicap" traces all the way down to the frameworks, architectures, and protocols we use to build them.  While great for building pages, they're the wrong tools for building apps.  Importantly: no amount of "adding more Web2" will fix this either.  Web4 is a different way to build apps that finally makes them competitive with their native app counterparts.  Web4 is not an extension of Web2, it's a re-reasoning from first principles, a fork in the opposite direction, a rejection of many Web2 staples like RESTful architectures, horizontal scaling, the way were write our SQL queries, and even the HTTP protocol itself.

Rylan is an Engineer and designer.  Always been attracted to building new & impossible things.  Never happy building with tech’s Current Thing™ though – hopelessly drawn to that bleeding edge, grassroots stench.  Been building for the web since 1999, mobile dev since 2004.  Author of the oldest indie app in the store.  Started a startup.  Raised VC.  Sold a startup. Made many mistakes. Learned a lot. Still trying to make that dent I promised the universe.
