# {{ title }}

MassTransit is a very popular message bus library for .NET which is usually implemented using Queueing technologies such as RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, or Amazon SQS.  But recently they've added support for Kafka and Azure EventHubs.  These stream based systems are powerful ways of passing messages, but also very different than Queues.  Come learn how MassTransit has enabled these technologies into their framework and how you can start using them today within your applications.
