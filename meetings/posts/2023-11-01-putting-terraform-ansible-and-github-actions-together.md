title: Putting Terraform, Ansible, and Github Actions Together

# {{ title }}

In [Last month's meeting](/meetings/posts/2023-10-04-david-and-justin-teach-eric-terraform/), I learned some Terraform. Originally we intended to deploy a Dotnet app but didn't get to it, and Terraform is about standing up infrastructure, not deploying. So in this meeting, we will be tying together Terraform for setting up infrastructure, Ansible for configuring a webserver, and Github actions to deploy a Dotnet app.

Like the last meeting, this will have a hands-on element to it. If you have Terraform and Ansible installed on your machine, you will be able to setup this entire workflow in just a few minutes and have your own automated infra setup and build.

If you are unfamiliar with any of these technologies, that's okay. We will also explain the basics of AWS, Terraform, and Ansible as we go along.
