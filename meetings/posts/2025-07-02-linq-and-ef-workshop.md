# {{ title }}

LINQ is a ubiquitous tool for .NET applications. You already know how to use it. Now learn how to use it well.
Learn several interlocking patterns that help you write performant and correct Entity Framework queries the first time. Fetch all of the information that you need in one round-trip. And transmit _only_ what you need.
This class is heavy on the practice. We'll code together during the session, so bring your laptop.

[Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.

Software is math. Every class is a theorem. The compiler is the proof. And unit tests check our work.

Michael wrote The Art of Immutable Architecture (now in a second edition), a book on applying mathematics to building distributed systems. Learn more at https://immutablearchitecture.com.

Michael has recorded Pluralsight courses on Distributed Systems, XAML Patterns, and Cryptography, in addition to Provable Code. Formerly a Microsoft MVP for seven years, he maintains the spoon-bending Assisticant and Jinaga open-source libraries. You can find his videos about distributed systems at historicalmodeling.com. And he helps his clients at Improving benefit from the power of software mathematics.
