In a galaxy not so far away, every user deserves a trusty sidekick like R2-D2â€”a copilot that truly understands their needs. What if our web apps could offer the same seamless interaction? In this presentation, we'll explore how to embed AI copilots into NextJS apps to read contextual data, such as user inputs, form elements, and navigation patterns. These copilots can make your app smarter and responding to context in real-time.  May the AI Be with you!

What you will learn:

* Embed a contextual chat feature: Engage users by answering queries and performing tasks based on conversational inputs.
* Enable action-driven assistance: Allow the copilot to autonomously perform tasks, boosting interactivity and efficiency.
* Offer dynamic content recommendations
