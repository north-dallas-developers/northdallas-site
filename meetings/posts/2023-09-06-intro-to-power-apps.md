<p>Are you a busy developer that constantly comes up with ideas for applications that could help your son's school, your local church or businesses in your area? Do you constantly have to turn down your friends and family members who have ideas for applications that could help their small business because you simply don't have time? PowerApps can help with this. Join us to learn more about the platform and how you can leverage it to help you help your loved ones while still staying on track timewise!</p>
