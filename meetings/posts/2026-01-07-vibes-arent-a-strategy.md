## **The Problem: The "Vibe Coding" Wall**
 
We’ve all experienced the magic of "vibe coding"—describing a feature to an AI and watching it come to life. But for greenfield projects, "vibes" quickly lead to architectural drift, context loss, and unmaintainable "spaghetti" code. The missing link isn't a better prompt; it’s a better **process**.
 
## **The Solution: Context Engineering via BMAD**
 
This hands-on session introduces the **BMAD Method (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development)**, a revolutionary framework that transforms AI from a chatty assistant into a structured, production-ready development team.
 
Participants will learn how to replace fuzzy prompts with **Context Engineering**. We will use the BMAD multi-agent workflow to greenfield an application from scratch—moving through a disciplined, four-phase lifecycle:
 
1. **Analysis:** Using specialized agents to brainstorm and research the project "North Star."
2. **Planning:** Generating high-fidelity PRDs and specs that provide the "source of truth."
3. **Solutioning:** Sharding documentation into actionable epics and stories to prevent context bloat.
4. **Implementation:** Orchestrating Developer and QA agents to execute code with zero "context loss."
 
## **Hands-On Experience**
 
Attendees will work through a live greenfield track, choosing between **Quick Flow** (for rapid prototyping) and the full **BMAD Method** (for robust platforms). You will see firsthand how to use the BMAD-Core flattener and agent-as-code patterns to maintain a single source of truth within your repository.
 
## **Key Takeaways**
 
* **Context Engineering Mastery:** Learn to design the structural context that AI agents need to build complex systems without hallucinations.
* **The Multi-Agent Team:** Understand the roles of the Analyst, Architect, and Scrum Master agents in a spec-driven environment.
* **Practical Tooling:** Get hands-on with the BMAD CLI and learn how to integrate it with IDEs like Cursor, Claude Code, or VS Code.
