# {{ title }}

Most developers have worked with queues—but there’s a lot more to messaging than just sending and receiving. In this session, we’ll go beyond the basics and explore powerful messaging patterns made easier with MassTransit. Learn how to implement request/response, retries, fault handling, dead-letter queues, and long-running workflows using sagas—all within your .NET applications. MassTransit simplifies the complexities of message orchestration across transports like RabbitMQ and Azure Service Bus, letting you focus on business logic, not boilerplate. Whether you're new to these patterns or ready to level up, this talk will sharpen your messaging architecture skills.
