# {{ title }}

Recently Russell and Eric have working on a few AI projects to build our skills in this area. We would like to share what we’ve learned and help you get started as well. We’ll be focusing on tools related to building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented-Generation) projects, and will discuss things like chunking, embedding, vector databases, and calling LLMs to generate responses.

This is a hands-on lab. Install python and bring your laptop. Walk away with some AI sample code running on your machine.

[Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.
