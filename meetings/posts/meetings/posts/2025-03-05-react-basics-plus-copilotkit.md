Last month Ron Dagdag talked to us about context-aware copilots in web apps. During the presentation, one tool he showed us was CopilotKit (https://www.copilotkit.ai/), a React-based set of tooling for building AI Copilots.

In this meeting we're going hands-on to learn some React basics with some CopilotKit sample applications. Bring your laptop.

What you need to have installed:

* Node 22 (or better, NVM)
* Any text editor
* Git
* Free CopilotKit Cloud account (https://docs.copilotkit.ai/quickstart)

Other recommended things:

* Install Ollama (https://ollama.com/)

You will walk away with a few sample applications running on your machine and a little more understanding of how React works so you can get started building your own apps.

[Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.
