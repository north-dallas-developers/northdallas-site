A UX Story from the world's most used white labeled travel site: how we use Sketches and rapid Prototyping to collaborate with our customers and experience innovation breakthroughs. If a picture is worth a 1000 words, then a prototype is worth 1000 meetings! Come learn the keys to rapid prototyping with tools you already have - paper and Power Point and the Design Studio Method.
