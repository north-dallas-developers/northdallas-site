What if your applications could instantly absorb and understand your company's most complex documents? In The Matrix Movie, Neo learned martial arts through a direct upload, instantly declaring, "I know kung fu." This session demonstrates how Azure AI Content Understanding brings that same principle to your unstructured data. We will conquer the chaos of call recordings, PDFs, and videos by systematically extracting structured, usable knowledge. By the end, you’ll know how to unlock hidden data across formats and wire it into search, analytics, and automation. 

[Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.
