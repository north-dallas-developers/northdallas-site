# {{ title }}

In this meeting, David L. Penton will discuss creating and running .NET Core apps that compile and run on both Mac and Windows, some basics of .NET Core, the .NET Core CLI, and different deployment models (framework dependent vs. self-contained deployments). This will have a git repo with the completed code, but we will start from scratch and work towards that completed code. David will demonstrate how you can develop seamlessly between Windows and Mac.
