**NOTE**: Due to the weather, we're going to try to do this virtually. Continue to RSVP so we know you're interested and can let you know. We'll update this when we know more.

As applications are becoming more cloud-based and cloud-native, developers need to understand network services and architecture.

This talk is for developers who need to understand more about network topology options and related services. Cloud providers offer network control options in various ways. Come to this presentation to learn about network options specific to Azure and AWS and how to better leverage network services, including security options.
