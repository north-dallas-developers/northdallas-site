**NOTE**: Due to the weather, we're going to do this virtually. [This is the link to join the Zoom call](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89342272459?pwd=Y3JqWVlBNm51UDI2WUo0cE5qNVpWUT09) (passcode 896546). Some of us will jump on around 6 but the presentation will not begin until 6:30.

As applications are becoming more cloud-based and cloud-native, developers need to understand network services and architecture.

This talk is for developers who need to understand more about network topology options and related services. Cloud providers offer network control options in various ways. Come to this presentation to learn about network options specific to Azure and AWS and how to better leverage network services, including security options.
