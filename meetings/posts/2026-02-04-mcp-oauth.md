## **MCP Auth Demo: Securing AI Tool Access with OAuth 2.1**
 
This demo showcases how to secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using OAuth 2.0, enabling AI assistants to safely and responsibly access external tools and data.

The session features a Python-based FastMCP server with authenticated tools, along with two Node.js–based OAuth authorization servers demonstrating:

- Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)
- Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD)–based registration

The demo walks through the complete Authorization Code flow with PKCE, including JWT validation using OIDC discovery and JWKS.

**Key takeaways include** how to apply OAuth 2.0 to MCP, compare DCR and CIMD approaches, and implement production-grade authentication patterns for AI integrations.
