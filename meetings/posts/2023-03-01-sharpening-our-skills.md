As developers, we spend a lot of time learning to keep up with new languages, libraries, patterns, and ways of thinking about code. But how often do we stop and think about how we learn? How often do we ask ourselves if we're going about the task of learning well? I think about it a great deal.

On Wednesday night, we're going to explore this. The core of our discussion will be around the ideas of two books, *[Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013)* and *[Peak: Secrets of the New Science of Expertise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak:_Secrets_from_the_New_Science_of_Expertise)*, along with some things I've learned along the way. The concepts are broadly applicable and you will leave with principles that you can apply to other subjects, though as a group of technologists, we'll focus on software development.

**NOTE**: This meeting is in-person. Also, [Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.

When not coding, he likes to read, study history, Bible, and so-called dead languages, think a lot about teaching, and play Age of Empires 2.
