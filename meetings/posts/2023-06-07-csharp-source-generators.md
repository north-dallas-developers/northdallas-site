Discover C# Source Generators ([official Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview)) and their approach to code generation that eliminates the need for templates, multiple compilations, and additional tools. In this session, we will explore the process of building source generators, discuss the types of problems you should solve with them, and understand their advantages over alternative approaches to code generation.

**NOTE**: This meeting is in-person. Also, [Improving](https://improving.com/) is providing pizza at 6:00 and the presentation will begin at 6:30.
